Santa wrote his first small script, to track the open gifts on the wishlist. However the script stopped working a couple of days ago and Santa has been stuck debugging the script. His sysadmin seems to be a bit funny ;)

# Solution

For this challenge we got a web shell to a linux box but were restricted to the user santa. Reading about restricted shell escape, I learned about `sudo` being able to not require a password for configured programs and that `sudo -l` can list your permissions in that. I noticed that `tcpdump` is among them and digged further. The most valuable resource was [this guide](https://insinuator.net/2019/07/how-to-break-out-of-restricted-shells-with-tcpdump/) on how to break out of restricted shells.

To test the escape, I created a small script inside /home/santa, called hack.sh and gave it +x permissions:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
whoami > /tmp/result
```

And I called it using the tcpdump technique from the resource above like this: `sudo tcpdump -nl -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /home/santa/hack.sh -Z root`, resulting in this:

This is promising! I then tried a few things like `ls -lah /` or `grep -R HV22 /`, but many of these commands were replaced by funny things (that's what the name is about!), so I finally did `chmod -R 777 /root` and searched the flag manually as santa:

Flag is **HV22{M4k3-M3-a-S4ndW1ch}**
