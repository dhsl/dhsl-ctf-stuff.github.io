So, we got a .gif file showing lot's of QR codes. The challenge is to split them frame by frame and read the codes, which is pretty straightforward.

Here is the file: ![source animated gif containing a bunch of QR codes](/assets/hv22_01_gif.gif)

I used PIL to open the image file and split it into frames and

```python
from PIL import Image
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode

im = Image.open('./hv22_01_gif.gif')
i = 0
result = ''

try:
    while 1:
        im.seek(i) # seeks to the next frame
        imframe = im.copy() # creates a copy of the frame
        decoded = decode(imframe) # uses pyzbar decoder
        result += decoded[0].data.decode('utf-8') # adds the decoded value to the result string
        i += 1
except EOFError:
    print(result)
    pass
```

This returns the flag **HV22{I_CaN_HaZ_Al_T3h_QRs_Plz}**
