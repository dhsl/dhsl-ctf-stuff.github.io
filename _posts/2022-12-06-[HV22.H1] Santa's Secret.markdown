# Solution

We know that the hidden flag must be somewhere in HV22.05, since it was first blooded there. Looking through the traffic dump again revealed nothing out of the ordinary.

Going to the 311k lines of the gcode manually doesn't seem to be feasible, so some statical analysis could help. We know that each line is a single opcode and by filtering out analyzed ones we can reduce the amount of lines drastically.

First one to rule out should probably be `G1`, since this makes up for about 308k lines or 99% of the file.

```bash
grep -v G1 hv22.gcode
```

Next one is G92:

```bash
grep -v -E 'G1|G92' hv22.gcode
```

When we did that, it's pretty empty in there, so not much to see here.

Next idea was to look for comments:

```bash
grep ';' hv22.gcode
```

This looks promising:

`72` and `86` jump straight into my eye as ascii values for `H` and `V` respectively. Extracting all the numbers from there, putting them into cyberchef to decode it to ascii reveals the flag **HV22{h1dd3n-fl4g!}**
