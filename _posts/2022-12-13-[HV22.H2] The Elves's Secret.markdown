Uhm...hello? What are you doing here? I thought you were tasked with finding a hidden flag in one of the medium challenges??

# Solution

The second hidden flag was hidden in the Screenshot Render Website from HV22.11. There was a hint that it was hidden in some tags, so I exhausted all the tag-related commands from aws cli and resigned for a moment.

The next day, I fired up the website again and simply tried inputs like `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/tags` and got lucky. Found the flag `HV22{5G0ldRing5QuickGetThem2MtDoom}`
