[**HACKvent2022**](https://hacking-lab.com/events/hackvent-2022) is history!

This was my first serious run at this challenge. I always enjoyed little hack-its and even solved a few challenges on hack the box, but never managed to do things like exploiting heap / stack on my own or even get that far with perfect score (solving all the challenges in the allocated time) or even solve all of them at all.

I learned so many things over the last month and am trying to do this write-up as understandable as possible to give a little bit back to the community.

This year was special for me, since I solved all the challenges (except one) on time and received the top scorer badge since I have the same amount of points as the 10th.

Update: If you factor in the writeups, I'm actually on place 7 now:

I also got awarded two badges:
